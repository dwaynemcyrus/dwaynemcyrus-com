# Sovereign Labs — Experimental Systems

Sovereign Labs is where I test the boundaries of applied AI — running experiments in memory, behavior, writing, and decision architecture. Each lab represents a question I’m trying to answer while building MirrorOS and its surrounding ecosystem.

These are not apps.  
They are **experiments in cognition.**

Each lab follows a simple methodology:

- Form a hypothesis  
- Build a prototype  
- Test under real constraints  
- Evaluate what the model understood  
- Document what I learned  
- Fold the insight back into the larger system  

This is how I build: not through ideas, but through *experiments*.
