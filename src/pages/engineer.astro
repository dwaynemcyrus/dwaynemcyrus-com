      <h2 class="hero-title">AI Design Engineer</h2>
<p>Availabile</p>
      <p class="hero-summary">
        I design and engineer AI systems that clarify decisions, reveal patterns, and streamline complex workflows —
        tools that think with you, not for you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Specialized in AI-driven tooling, human-centered systems, reasoning pipelines, and local-first architectures.
        I build where product design, intelligence, and engineering intersect — creating systems that reduce cognitive
        load and strengthen user intent.

    <!-- OPERATING PRINCIPLES -->
    <section class="section section-principles">
      <h2>Operating Principles</h2>
      <p>Philosophy: Design as discipline. Engineering as order. AI as clarity.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AI must reduce effort.</strong> If it does not eliminate steps, it is unnecessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Interfaces must be self-explanatory.</strong> Users should not need documentation to proceed.</li>
        <li><strong>Clarity beats cleverness.</strong> Architecture and flow must be legible.</li>
        <li><strong>AI should be invisible.</strong> Integrated into the flow, not bolted on.</li>
        <li><strong>Systems should age well.</strong> Maintainability and predictability matter.</li>
        <li><strong>Local-first when it increases trust and speed.</strong> Used for reliability, not novelty.</li>
        <li><strong>AI must support intent.</strong> Where intelligence strengthens the user’s workflow, never overrides it.</li>
        <li><strong>AI must be structurally grounded.</strong> No intelligence should exist without a supporting architecture.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>MirrorOS</strong><br />
        Tactical emotional intelligence system for men under pressure — an applied-AI operating layer that turns raw
        emotional events into structured clarity, behavioral patterns, and command protocols, with privacy as a first
        principle.

      <p>
        Sovereign Labs is where I prototype the subsystems that feed into MirrorOS: memory, behavior, narrative, and
        decision architecture.
